  abstract = {We present a practical technique for spectrum and spectral density estimation from long time series by Fourier transforms. We apply Welch's popular technique of ``averaging over modified periodograms'' which uses Fourier transforms of fixed length with time-domain windows and overlap. Our technique retains the basic properties of this method, but computes the optimal frequency resolution individually for each Fourier frequency on a logarithmic frequency axis, thus yielding results that are more useful than those of the standard techniques.},
