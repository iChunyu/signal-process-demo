    Fourier transform opened a door to analyze signal in frequency domain, from which a series of transforms were born, such as Laplace transform for system design and Z transform for discrete analysis.

    Power spectrum density is a powerful tool to analyze random signal in frequency domain, while a class of filters can change the frequency properties of a given signal.
